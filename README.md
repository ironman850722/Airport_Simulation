Airport Simulation is a short animation designed by C++ programming language. This project contains mathematical knowledge, such as Trigonometric functions and Vectors properties. In this project, I calculated the flying path of the airplane correctly, so the airplane can fly in the sky with a reasonable inclination. Also, for the landing airplane at night, the light intensity on the hangar's wall becomes stronger when the airplane getting closer to the hangar.
